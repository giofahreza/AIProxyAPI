# AI Proxy API

> **Note:** This project is a fork of [router-for-me/CLIProxyAPI](https://github.com/router-for-me/CLIProxyAPI).

A proxy server that provides OpenAI/Gemini/Claude/Codex compatible API interfaces for CLI.

It supports OpenAI Codex (GPT models), Claude Code, Gemini, and more via OAuth.

Use local or multi-account CLI access with OpenAI (including Responses)/Gemini/Claude-compatible clients and SDKs.

## Overview

- OpenAI/Gemini/Claude compatible API endpoints for CLI models
- OpenAI Codex support (GPT models) via OAuth login
- Claude Code support via OAuth login
- Qwen Code support via OAuth login
- iFlow support via OAuth login
- Amp CLI and IDE extensions support with provider routing
- Streaming and non-streaming responses
- Function calling/tools support
- Multimodal input support (text and images)
- Multiple accounts with round-robin load balancing (Gemini, OpenAI, Claude, Qwen and iFlow)
- Simple CLI authentication flows (Gemini, OpenAI, Claude, Qwen and iFlow)
- Generative Language API Key support
- AI Studio Build multi-account load balancing
- Gemini CLI multi-account load balancing
- Claude Code multi-account load balancing
- Qwen Code multi-account load balancing
- iFlow multi-account load balancing
- OpenAI Codex multi-account load balancing
- OpenAI-compatible upstream providers via config (e.g., OpenRouter)
- Reusable Go SDK for embedding the proxy (see `docs/sdk-usage.md`)

## Management API

see [MANAGEMENT_API.md](https://help.router-for.me/management/api)

## Amp CLI Support

AIProxyAPI includes integrated support for [Amp CLI](https://ampcode.com) and Amp IDE extensions, enabling you to use your Google/ChatGPT/Claude OAuth subscriptions with Amp's coding tools:

- Provider route aliases for Amp's API patterns (`/api/provider/{provider}/v1...`)
- Management proxy for OAuth authentication and account features
- Smart model fallback with automatic routing
- **Model mapping** to route unavailable models to alternatives (e.g., `claude-opus-4.5` → `claude-sonnet-4`)
- Security-first design with localhost-only management endpoints
